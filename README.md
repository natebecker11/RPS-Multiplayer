# RPS-Multiplayer
A Multiplayer Rock-Paper-Scissors Game


## Core Features
Two users compete in a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Each user selects Rock, Paper or Scissors, then once both have selected, the winner is revealed to both. Wins, losses and ties for both are tallied on-screen. When two users are already playing, additional players are asked to wait. When a player quits, the other player is informed and the game resets.

## Stretch features
- [ ] Support for multiple games at once, IE some sort of match-making system to separate groups of 2 players into several concurrent games.
- [ ] Chat box so users can send messages.
